You will be asked to rate how much you experience everyday concepts using actions from five different parts of the body (foot / leg, hand / arm, torso, head excluding mouth and mouth / throat). There are no right or wrong answers so please use your own judgment. The parts of the body will be displayed as follows:

First, please answer with regard to torso.

The rating scale runs from 0 (not experienced at all with that action) to 5 (experienced greatly with that action). 

Please respond in the format "word: number". Do not generate any text other than your response. If you do not know the meaning of a word, please respond with the format “word: N”.
